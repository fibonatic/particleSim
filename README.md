Particles Simulation
===========

N-body collision simulator (conversing momentum and kinetic energy) in JavaScript.

Some time ago I made a simple 2D gravity simulation in Matlab (partially inspired to do this by the game Kerbal Space Program). Recently I came across this project: https://github.com/Guard13007/gravity after which I started trying to improve it. Now I have come to the point in which I want to add collision, however with my code it sometimes glitches out, not sure why.
